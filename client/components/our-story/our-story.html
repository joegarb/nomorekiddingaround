            Love at First Sight? Well...
        </p>
        <p class="our-story-timeline-content">
            Allison and Joe may have met in high school, but they are hardly high school sweethearts. In fact, depending on who you ask, you’ll get quite different answers as to how these two lovebirds first met. Allison, ever the historian more attuned to facts and details, will tell you that they met in August 2002 on a bus during her first high school marching band trip (she still remembers that it was raining outside). It was her freshman year, and Joe’s senior year. Yet Joe, one more concerned with events that actually matter, will simply tell you that although the two went to high school together, it was not until after countless run-ins at Clemson University and through mutual acquaintances did they become more acquainted themselves. Either way, they both admit that a mutual attraction existed throughout. Yet either because of their age difference (a whopping three years in high school was no joke!), distance, Joe’s shyness, or different career paths, nothing much had ever come of their coincidental encounters.

            The First Date
        </p>
        <p class="our-story-timeline-content">
            Again, depending on who you ask, where and when the first date occurred is quite a controversial question. What was the initial symbolic gesture that led to all future events to come? Joe never officially asked Allison on a date, and vice versa, so things can be a little confusing. There was the cup of coffee Joe quizzically bought Allison in May 2014 during his spur-of-the-moment trip to New York City (one that actually made her think that it was time for a trip to Boston - which she took, only to find that Joe was on a vacation in England!). Then there was the brunch they shared in Boston at South Street Diner as Allison awaited her return train to New York after spending Thanksgiving 2014 with her family in Massachusetts. Joe bought Allison another coffee and a flurry of texts ensued once they returned to their respective abodes in NYC and Boston, but nothing was made official. Then there is Allison’s personal favorite that occurred the following month while they were both visiting their families over the Christmas holiday—a late night dinner at a Waffle House in Lugoff, South Carolina in December 2014 that Joe insisted on paying for. At the end of the night, Allison waited for Joe to say something about it all as she helped him unload his suitcase from her car. He dropped his suitcase on her, immediately apologized, and wished her goodnight. And then there was their trip the following week to see the Christmas Lights at Columbia’s Riverbanks Zoo. It was there that Joe first put his arm around Allison, without saying a word, in front of her college friends. It was this awkward and special, and quite literally longest night of the year (the Winter Solstice), that Joe claims was their official first date.

            There and Back Again
        </p>
        <p class="our-story-timeline-content">
            Only a few short months after we started dating we knew we wanted to be married (yes, you read that correctly, Joe liked it so much he would have put a ring on it after 5 months! these apples really don’t fall far from their trees…). However, our task ahead was more a matter of figuring out how to make our drastically different lives in Boston and NYC slowly coincide and intertwine. 2015 through 2016 seem almost like a blur to us now. Those years included a glorious 3 month-long stint in Rome, weekend trips to Maine, Montreal, San Francisco, Paris, and Milan, and summer trips to Sicily, Istanbul, Berlin, Croatia, and Venice. But those years also included almost weekly 10hr roundtrip bus and train rides between Boston and NYC, and up to 6 months combined time over the years that the two had to spend apart on opposite sides of the Atlantic.

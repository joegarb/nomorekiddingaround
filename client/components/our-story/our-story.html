                                Allison and Joe may have met in high school, but they are hardly high school sweethearts. In fact, depending on who you ask, you’ll get quite different answers as to how these two lovebirds first met. Allison, ever the historian more attuned to facts and details, will tell you that they met in August 2002 on a bus during her first high school marching band trip (she still remembers that it was raining outside). It was her freshman year, and Joe’s senior year. Yet Joe, one more concerned with events that actually matter, will simply tell you that although the two went to high school together, it was not until after countless run-ins at Clemson University and through mutual acquaintances did they become more acquainted themselves. Either way, they both admit that a mutual attraction existed throughout. Yet either because of their age difference (a whopping three years in high school was no joke!), distance, Joe’s shyness, or different career paths, nothing much had ever come of their coincidental encounters.

                                Again, depending on who you ask, where and when the first date occurred is quite a controversial question. What was the initial symbolic gesture that led to all future events to come? Joe never officially asked Allison on a date, and vice versa, so things can be a little confusing. There was the cup of coffee Joe quizzically bought Allison in May 2014 during his spur-of-the-moment trip to New York City (one that actually made her think that it was time for a trip to Boston - which she took, only to find that Joe was on a vacation in England!). Then there was the brunch they shared in Boston at South Street Diner as Allison awaited her return train to New York after spending Thanksgiving 2014 with her family in Massachusetts. Joe bought Allison another coffee and a flurry of texts ensued once they returned to their respective abodes in NYC and Boston, but nothing was made official. Then there is Allison’s personal favorite that occurred the following month while they were both visiting their families over the Christmas holiday—a late night dinner at a Waffle House in Lugoff, South Carolina in December 2014 that Joe insisted on paying for. At the end of the night, Allison waited for Joe to say something about it all as she helped him unload his suitcase from her car. He dropped his suitcase on her, immediately apologized, and wished her goodnight. And then there was their trip the following week to see the Christmas Lights at Columbia’s Riverbanks Zoo. It was there that Joe first put his arm around Allison, without saying a word, in front of her college friends. It was this awkward and special, and quite literally longest night of the year (the Winter Solstice), that Joe claims was their official first date.

                                Much like their own parents, who each got married a short time after their first dates, it was only a few short months after Allison and Joe started dating that they knew they wanted to get married. (These apples really don’t fall far from their trees). However, they were happy to wait this one out, as Allison had a PhD to finish and the two to had yet to figure out how to make their drastically different lives in Boston and NYC slowly coincide and intertwine. 2015 and 2016 seem almost like a blur to them now. Those years included a glorious 3 month-long stint in Rome, weekend trips to Maine, Montreal, San Francisco, Paris, and Milan, and summer trips to Istanbul, Berlin, Venice, Sicily, and Croatia. As blissful as these excursions may sound, those years also included torturous, almost weekly 10hr roundtrip bus and train rides between Boston and NYC, and up to 6 months combined time over the years that the two had to spend apart on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

                                When Joe moved to New York in January 2017, he had already planned to propose to Allison. Little did Joe know that Allison had already caught on, having accidentally overheard Joe and her dad talk about the affair over the holidays. Nevertheless, Allison did not (initially) know how or when it would happen. Among a spring of what seemed like endless proposals and engagement parties for their other friends, it was hard for Joe to do scheming of his own. Despite their differences of opinion regarding their first date, Joe had the idea to return to where he argued it all began, the zoo. Yet while planning their visit to the Bronx Zoo, much to Joe’s surprise, Allison abruptly expressed her general dislike of zoos. It was not until a week or so later at a friend’s party, while overhearing Joe’s description of their “first date” at the zoo, did Allison realize what Joe’s true intentions were for his planned trip. Immediately thereafter, Allison was amenable to his suggestion, yet by that point, Joe had detected that his charade might be up, so he tried to throw Allison off the scent by suggesting different ideas of what to do for the day instead of going to the zoo. It was no use.

                                Sunday, April 9, 2017. The big day started with a clear sign for Allison (who is, if you haven’t learned by now, the hardest person to surprise). She spotted the shape of a box in Joe's jacket pocket, and instantly knew that she was correct about their Bronx Zoo excursion. The trip - by subway and foot - had Joe feeling quite nervous and uncomfortable about the valuable ring in his pocket, not to mention the nerves and excitement anticipating the proposal. Though the weather was beautiful, the zoo was crowded with bossy parents and screaming children, so Joe ultimately decided that it was not the right place for a proposal (much to Allison's appreciation, as she felt the same way!). Upon leaving, the two decided to walk home through Central Park. For Joe, this was perfect - it was a beautiful day, and Central Park was a significant part of Joe and Allison's lives in New York. However, improvising to find ‘the perfect spot’ as they walked proved difficult, as it seemed that every New Yorker was in Central Park that day. Joe tried to discretely survey potential spots as they walked, but it was to no avail. Allison noticed and tried to help him along by saying, "Looking for a good rock?" The jig was officially up. By the time they neared the park’s exit near home and the sun had begun to set, Allison thought that the proposal wasn't going to happen. Just before exiting, Joe suddenly took her by the arm and said, "Let's walk a little longer." They walked just a bit farther and at long last came to a secluded area. With sore feet, Allison took a seat to rest and Joe finally did what they both knew was the point of the whole day. Joe got down on one knee, said that he wanted every future of his Sundays to be as perfect as this one, and asked Allison to marry him. The rest is history.

            Love at First Sight? Well...
        </p>
        <p class="our-story-timeline-content">
            Allison and Joe may have met in high school, but they are hardly high school sweethearts. In fact, depending on who you ask, you’ll get quite different answers as to how these two lovebirds first met. Allison, ever the historian more attuned to facts and details, will tell you that they met in August 2002 on a bus during her first high school marching band trip (she still remembers that it was raining outside). It was her freshman year, and Joe’s senior year. Yet Joe, one more concerned with events that actually matter, will simply tell you that although the two went to high school together, it was not until after countless run-ins at Clemson University and through mutual acquaintances did they become more acquainted themselves. Either way, they both admit that a mutual attraction existed throughout. Yet either because of their age difference (a whopping three years in high school was no joke!), distance, Joe’s shyness, or different career paths, nothing much had ever come of their coincidental encounters.

            The First Date
        </p>
        <p class="our-story-timeline-content">
            Again, depending on who you ask, where and when the first date occurred is quite a controversial question. What was the initial symbolic gesture that led to all future events to come? Joe never officially asked Allison on a date, and vice versa, so things can be a little confusing. There was the cup of coffee Joe quizzically bought Allison in May 2014 during his spur-of-the-moment trip to New York City (one that actually made her think that it was time for a trip to Boston - which she took, only to find that Joe was on a vacation in England!). Then there was the brunch they shared in Boston at South Street Diner as Allison awaited her return train to New York after spending Thanksgiving 2014 with her family in Massachusetts. Joe bought Allison another coffee and a flurry of texts ensued once they returned to their respective abodes in NYC and Boston, but nothing was made official. Then there is Allison’s personal favorite that occurred the following month while they were both visiting their families over the Christmas holiday—a late night dinner at a Waffle House in Lugoff, South Carolina in December 2014 that Joe insisted on paying for. At the end of the night, Allison waited for Joe to say something about it all as she helped him unload his suitcase from her car. He dropped his suitcase on her, immediately apologized, and wished her goodnight. And then there was their trip the following week to see the Christmas Lights at Columbia’s Riverbanks Zoo. It was there that Joe first put his arm around Allison, without saying a word, in front of her college friends. It was this awkward and special, and quite literally longest night of the year (the Winter Solstice), that Joe claims was their official first date.

            There and Back Again
        </p>
        <p class="our-story-timeline-content">
            Only a few short months after we started dating we knew we wanted to be married (yes, you read that correctly, Joe liked it so much he would have put a ring on it after 5 months! these apples really don’t fall far from their trees…). However, our task ahead was more a matter of figuring out how to make our drastically different lives in Boston and NYC slowly coincide and intertwine. 2015 through 2016 seem almost like a blur to us now. Those years included a glorious 3 month-long stint in Rome, weekend trips to Maine, Montreal, San Francisco, Paris, and Milan, and summer trips to Sicily, Istanbul, Berlin, Croatia, and Venice. But those years also included almost weekly 10hr roundtrip bus and train rides between Boston and NYC, and up to 6 months combined time over the years that the two had to spend apart on opposite sides of the Atlantic.

            The Proposal
        </p>
        <p class="our-story-timeline-content">
            In January 2017 Joe moved to New York, and planned to take the next step. How to propose? He felt pretty sure that Allison wouldn't be thrilled with a public proposal at a sporting event, or atop the Empire State Building, or while ice skating at Rockefeller Center. So he had the idea to revisit part of where it all began, the zoo - and since we were in New York, it would be the Bronx Zoo. While planning the day, he detected that Allison had figured out that he was planning to propose, so he tried to throw her off the scent by suggesting different ideas of what to do for the day instead of going to the zoo. And indeed, Allison had caught on. As she later revealed, she initially thought it merely odd that Joe would suggest going to the zoo despite the fact that she had previously mentioned her dislike of zoos; but while at a friend's party she overheard Joe describing their "first date" at the Riverbanks Zoo, and she suddenly realized what he must have had in mind. Thus when the time came, she was quite amenable to his suggestion of visiting the Bronx Zoo.

        <p class="our-story-timeline-content">
            Fast forward to the big day: Sunday, April 9, 2017. It started out with a pretty clear sign for Allison - she spotted the shape of a box in Joe's jacket pocket, and instantly knew, but she kept quiet about it. So we made our way to the Bronx Zoo. The trip - by subway and foot - had Joe feeling quite nervous and uncomfortable about the valuable ring in his pocket, not to mention the nerves and excitement he felt anticipating the proposal. Unfortunately for his plans, though it was a very nice day we both felt underwhelmed by the zoo and its visitors, and Joe decided to himself that it wasn't the right place (much to Allison's appreciation, as she felt the same way!). We left the zoo, and at Allison's suggestion decided to walk through Central Park to get back home rather than taking the subway directly home. This, Joe decided, was the right time and place - it was a beautiful day, and Central Park was a significant part of Joe and Allison's lives in New York, so what better place? However, improvising to find "the perfect spot" as we walked proved difficult, since it seemed that every single New Yorker was in Central Park that day (one of the first nice days of Spring). Joe tried to discretely survey potential spots as we walked, including several large rocky outcroppings (that unfortunately had people already occupying them), but Allison clearly noticed and said something like, "Looking for a good rock?" The jig was up. We eventually got close to home and Allison thought to herself that it wasn't going to happen - but Joe suddely took her by the arm before exiting the park and said, "Let's walk a little longer." We walked just a little bit farther and at long last came to a nice spot that was relatively quiet and free of other people. There Allison took a seat to rest (we had covered a lot of ground), and Joe finally came to his senses and did what we both knew was the point of the whole day - he got down on one knee, said that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Allison, and asked her to marry him. Allison - through joyful tears - of course said yes! And after a few phone calls to share the good news with loved ones, we ended the evening with the most amazing meal at Gramercy Tavern, a Michelin star restaurant.

                    Charleston International Airport is located 12 miles (19 km) northwest of downtown Charleston and services Alaska, Allegiant, American Airlines, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, and United Airlines. Uber is readily available, as is the Downtown Shuttle for $14 per person.

                    Once in Charleston, the city is easily walkable, and well-serviced by Lyft and Uber.

                    If you plan to drive, this should be self-explanatory. However, please note that parking in downtown Charleston can be difficult. While meters do not charge on Sundays (the day of our wedding), it is often quite challenging to find available on-street parking.

                    Parking Garages:

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The nearest parking garage to The Old Exchange (our reception venue) is the East Bay Parking Garage, which charges $16 for the daily maximum.

                    We <u>strongly encourage</u> using sites such as <a href="https://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> or <a href="https://www.homeaway.com" target="_blank">Homeaway</a> to find accommodations, as hotels in downtown Charleston are quite expensive and you can usually find a much better deal on one of these sites. And it'd be a great idea to book a larger place together with other family members or friends!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you instead prefer a traditional hotel, below are some recommendations. We unfortunately were not able to secure special rates for our wedding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Mount Pleasant</b> - these are located across the river from downtown, so you'll need a car (or Lyft/Uber), but it's only a very short ride, so these may be your best bet for saving money over staying downtown.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>North Charleston</b> - near the airport, but a bit further of a drive from downtown than the hotels in Mount Pleasant. A car is needed to get downtown, but you'll likely find the best rates in this area, and there are many more hotels to choose from than what's listed here.

                    <b>Downtown</b> - where our wedding is taking place, you can conveniently walk anywhere, including to our wedding venues as well as the historic district and many great shops and restaurants. But the nightly rates for hotels in this area are the highest, with many being boutique hotels. (We don't have specific recommendations among these).

                Apart from Clemson, Charleston holds a special place in our hearts. Joe lived there for over 5 years, and Allison’s parents in fact had their own first date there! It is the pride and joy of South Carolina, and we are so excited to celebrate our special day with each of you in one of our favorite cities in the world. Charleston has consistently been ranked by Conde Nast’s Travel+Leisure as one of the country’s top cities to visit since 2013, and in 2016 it was listed as the top destination to visit in the world. There is little we can say to top this, though we’d like to add that we have been singing this city’s praises long before these Yankee travel magazines. We always feel at home in the city and hope that you enjoy all the wonderful historic sites, food, shopping, beaches, and Southern hospitality Charleston has to offer.

                Luckily for you, November is a wonderful time of year to visit Charleston. You’ll have a chance to enjoy the city without mosquitoes or hurricanes. Temperatures will likely be neither too hot or too cold, though we cannot guarantee that it will be entirely humidity free!

                                    <p>FIG is arguably one of the best restaurants in Charleston with one of the most talented chefs, Jason Stanhope (it was named by Eater as one of America’s top 3 restaurants in 2016). Its magic lies in his small plates crafted from hyper-local, seasonal ingredients. The dining room is very formal and difficult to secure reservations, though the best seat in the house is at the lively bar.</p>

                                    <p>Though located a short distance from the main tourist-hub of Charleston, this neighborhood gem has somehow evaded the recent inundation of visitors far and wide (so be sure to keep this one a secret!). Since 1922, Queen Street Grocery has served as an apothecary, grocery, corner store, and restaurant alike, with all four evident in its now eclectic and charming atmosphere. Today you can find anything from savory crepes, omelettes, and sammies to smoothies, coffee, and to-go craft beers and wine, making this the perfect leisurely and relaxed escape.</p>

                                    <p>Rue de Jean is one of Allison’s personal favorites for lunch 15 years and counting. Located just off of King Street, Rue is just what you would expect for Charleston’s take on French cuisine. Housed in a former two-story brick warehouse built in 1880, the restaurant has the perfect combination of huge antique mirrors, high-top tables and booths, and tin ceiling tiles to make you feel like a Parisian expat. The escargots are a MUST - even if they aren’t your thing, order them and dip Rue’s fresh-baked bread in the white-wine garlic butter sauce!</p>

                                    <p>While this one may not be within walking distance to the downtown area, a short car ride or Uber trip will take you to this Mediterranean-inspired, Southern restaurant that is all about locally (and ethically) sourced ingredients. While their brunch is simply not to be missed, they are also well known for their mezze plate, which features several of the restaurant’s most popular side items, such as kale slaw, kohlrabi with yogurt, field peas, and bacon wrapped dates. The menu changes daily, so be sure to check Facebook and Twitter for the most updated versions.</p>

                                    <p>At the southern tip of the Charleston peninsula, where the Cooper and Ashley Rivers meet to join the Atlantic Ocean, you’ll find a park lined with luxurious antebellum mansions on one side and expansive views of the Charleston harbor and Fort Sumter on the other. Noted by the first Carolina colonists in 1670 as "Oyster Point" or "White Point" (monikers designating the gleaming, white-washed oysters piled upon the shore by Native Americans), the land was later built up as an important defensive unit during the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and again during the American Civil War. Several cannons, statues, and memorials lining the park pay tribute to significant events and people in local history. A promenade atop the sea-walls along the water’s edge encircles the park, and can be followed all the way to the historic Rainbow Row and beyond to the recently restored Waterfront Park.</p>

                                    <p>Located on lower Meeting Street, the Gibbes is certainly an overlooked gem in Charleston, one that even many locals have not explored. While a majority of their permanent collection is dedicated to the art and visual culture of the Americas, spanning the colonial period to the present day, they also maintain noteworthy collections such as the Marks Collection of early twentieth-century photography, the Read Japanese Print Collection, and the Ballard Collection of European prints and drawings. Like many art museums today, the building the art is housed in is itself quite impressive (a two-story Beaux Arts style edifice designed by architect Frank Milburn with a stunning stained glass dome in its rotunda).</p>

                                    <p>Founded in 1676 by Thomas and Ann Drayton of Barbados, Magnolia Plantation and its beautiful gardens features many firsts for not only the Lowcountry but also the United States - the plantation owners introduced the first azaleas in the U.S., were the first to utilize Camellia Japonica in an outdoor setting, and they are the oldest public gardens in America having been opened in the wake of the Reconstruction Era in 1870. Yet it is not history that brings visitors to this site but rather its beautiful location. With sections of the property and gardens left unrestored for over 325 years, the property is quintessentially idyllic (with free-roaming peacocks) and hosts many blooming plant varietals year-round. Those species expected to be in bloom come November include Canna Lilies, Confederate Rose, Encore Azaleas, Four O’clock, Ginger, Hydrangea, Knockout Roses, Lantana, Loquat, Mexican Tarragon, Morning Glory, Ruellia, Russian Sage, Sasanqua Camellia, Sweet Grass, and Tea Olive.</p>
                                    <p>In addition to the house, tours of the grounds and wetlands are given daily, where you’re guaranteed to spot alligators, turtles, egrets, and herons. For those of you traveling with children, a stop by The Petting Zoo & Nature Center is also recommended, where visitors can view local species, including the gray fox, beaver, bobcat, and birds of prey, and visit the on-site reptile house, where guests are allowed to safely encounter some of the state's native lizards, turtles, and snakes.</p>

                                    <p>Located 8 miles from Downtown Charleston on the banks of the Wampacheone Creek stands Boone Hall, a mansion and accompanying plantation estate established in 1681. To this day Boone Hall serves not only as a tourist attraction but also as one of America’s oldest working farms, best known for its cotton and pecans, and still actively producing strawberries, tomatoes, peaches. While the mansion that stands on the property today was built in 1936 by Canadian ambassador Thomas Stone as part of the Second Wave of Reconstruction, the true value of the site rests with its critically acclaimed Black History and Slave History Exhibit and Tours that are presented using nine of the original slave cabins located on the estate that were built between 1790 and 1810. Each of these buildings presents different themes in telling the black history story, with some stories particularly unique to those who lived in the South Carolina Lowcountry (1. Praise House, 2. Heritage Of Sweetgrass Baskets, 3. Their Life &amp; Family, 4. Archaeological Discoveries, 5. Their Work and Life, 6. Emancipation &amp; Freedom, 7. Struggle For Civil Rights, 8.

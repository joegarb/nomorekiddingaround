                        As Joe's big sister, Hannah blazed the trail and continues to do so. Hannah deserves all the credit for taking heat from their parents as the firstborn, making it a lot easier for Joe during their childhood! Obviously they've known each other for a lifetime, but they became closer as they grew older. As adults they became roommates once again in Charleston, during which time Hannah taught Joe how to go his own way (although he'd say he can never do it nearly as well as she). Not only is she one of the bravest people we know, she's also a super cool urbanite – not a hipster but a real, gritty, engaged member of her 'hood. We both admire Hannah in too many ways to count, and are thrilled to be able to share our big day with her.

                        Many of you may wonder how two people so completely different could have been born to the same parents. As Allison's one and only younger sister, Meredith collected all of the magnificent character traits that seemed to bypass Allison on the first go-around in the Kidd family. She is wonderfully charismatic, can make even the toughest critics laugh, is as chill as a cucumber on most days, and has an enchanting Southern accent. Luckily for us, these traits perfectly complement Allison's, and we expect to defer to her for all our small-talk, jokes, and stress management needs as we make our way to the big day. We are slightly worried, as Meredith happens to know all of Allison's secrets (for better or worse!), and we're not quite sure which of these will surface as comedic relief during her wedding toast.

                        Little did Amr know during his interview with Joe for a job at Wayfair that the two would not only work together on the same team but would also quickly become close friends. Over the years, their friendship took them from coding and hack-a-thons to ski trips in Maine (where Amr learned that he far prefers hot tubs over skiing) to kayak excursions in Concord. Through Amr's gracious and benevolent hospitality, he has introduced Joe to many Middle Eastern delicacies and traditions (schwarma and falafel). In return, Allison has introduced Amr to the best of American delicacies (such as animal crackers) while Joe has taught Amr how to employ American idioms (the classic "that's what she said" is among his top favorites). Amr's loving and caring nature has known no bounds. As one of the most hospitable people we've ever met, he has shared with us many holidays, meals, and most importantly, his close friendship.

As Charleston escapees, they took on adventure in Iceland, where they explored hot springs and snowy waterfalls, and sung Billy Joel with friendly Icelanders at 3am (an event Allison would have to see to believe). Having been bitten by the travel bug, Andy and Joe were eager to escape for another adventure together, this time on a hike through Switzerland. As a new bug came along, the love bug, Andy was also there as Joe's confidant for his biggest adventure of all, dating Allison. Although their latest paths have drawn them geographically apart as they criss-crossed the country and the globe, Andy remains a dear friend and a jolly bearded companion.

                        It all began in 2012, when Allison and Arielle first moved to NYC and shared an apartment with each other. Though they had never met before that August, they quickly bonded as Southern renegades in the Big Apple as they explored the city together and shared their crazy daily encounters over dinners, pajama parties, and late-night conversations. Arielle's move to Seattle in 2014, though heartwrenching, opened up enough space in their hearts to fall in love with their other life partners. In 2017 they both returned to their beloved Upper West Side to live a mere 13 blocks apart from each other. When Arielle is not busy saving the world, she occupies her spare time by taking care of her friends. She has a remarkable amount of energy, positivity, and love to go around. During Allison's long summer absence abroad, Arielle made sure that Joe was never wanting for company, and shared with him the same loving kindness and friendship that she first shared with Allison in 2012.

                        Britt is one of those rare souls who is so loving, warm, and compassionate that you only have to know her for 5 minutes before you feel as if she's been your closest friend for a lifetime. That's precisely what happened when she and Allison first met in 2014; intending to catch-up on work at a cafe, they instead found themselves passing the whole afternoon talking with each other about work, life, and social politics. It happened yet again in 2016 when she moved to NYC where she hooked Joe with her ever positive, bubbly, and infectiously fun personality (characteristics that also match her preferred drink of choice, prosecco). Britt epitomizes true friendship, and continues to amaze us with her deep devotion to humans of all walks of life and her unremitting benevolence. There are indeed few in this world who would voluntarily (with enthusiam) drive a 10 hour round trip in the span of less than 2 days just to see Allison and Joe before Allison's annual summer exodus.

Yet as Joe's eldest brother by a solid 1 minute, David also watched out for Joe and has long served as a shining example to him of a moral and cheerful individual. As they've grown older they continue to share many passions, such as the the pursuit of great food and a deep love of strong coffee (we are indebted to him for the many pounds of coffee and the several cafe accoutrements now in our possession). David's generosity seems to know no limits, and he has always gone above and beyond the duties of an older brother – like breaking the rules of a family gift exchange by bringing us more gifts than allowed!

                        First cousin once-removed, or second cousin, no term properly suits Jennifer's relationship to Allison better than "cousin, closest to an older sister she's ever have." Allison and Jennifer grew up together as part of an insane Italian-American family, passing many of their earliest summer breaks together with their two (actual) sisters in New Jersey, Myrtle Beach, and Disney World. During those formative years, they taught each other how to properly eat grits and pierogis, how to catch fireflies in the backyard, and how to go crabbin'. Most importantly, Jennifer taught Allison that it was o.k. to be a bit of a nerd and that there are few greater virtues than being true to oneself. Jennifer is one of the most genuine, loyal, and loving people we know. Her wedding last year has continued to serve as an inpiration to us as we plan our own, and just as we were thrilled to be a part of her special day then, we are overjoyed that she will be joining us this upcoming November.

What began with their mocking of soccer players (Cristiano Ronaldo, an easy target), passion for the study of history and politics, and their love of travel soon turned to their desire to shake off the dust of South Carolina and take on the world. Always ever a source of inspiration for Allison, Keller Anne has always been by her side as together they explored the exciting yet trecherous waters of relationships, professional pursuits, and women's empowerment. Keller Anne's love for Joe was unconditional from the start (indeed, she cried out of pure joy the first time Allison told her about this new man in her life, as if she knew even then that the result would be wedding bells). 1.

                        Allison knew that Joe would be a keeper the night she first introduced him to Luke and his brother, Mac. Her fear that Joe might not get along with two of her closest friends from Clemson quickly subsided when, within minutes of introducing the three, they were busy in conversation while Allison was left by herself to finish cooking that evening's meal. Since that wonderful evening, Luke has perfectly mediated the two opposite left-brain / right-brain spheres that Joe and Allison occupy, somehow managing to keep up simultaneous conversations on coding and front-end design with one and inquisitive thoughtpieces on humanism and philosophy with the other. Though we take advantage of his proximity to Charlotte's airport more than we'd like to admit, it is the best excuse to spend an extra day with this individual who we admire so much for his endless supply of positivity, wit, and his genuine acceptance of those who are most different from him.

                        It is impossible to pinpoint when Mac and Allison first met, though it was early during their freshman year at Clemson in 2006. From spring break trips, football games, weekly ultimate frisbee matches, and house parties to Skype calls from England, dropped phone calls from Mozambique, and intense graduate school exams in NYC and Charleston, the two have been through thick and thin over the past 11 years. This Marshall Mathers-lovin', orange crocs-rockin', mathematician turned Peace Corps volunteer turned medical practioner is more like a brother than a dear friend to Allison. So much so that when he first heard of Joe, his protective instincts immediately kicked in. He wanted to be sure of Joe's intentions before he could be excited about this rather sudden and serious relationship (of course, he had nothing to worry about!). It is precisely this selfless concern and love for others, as well as his remarkable ability to bring a smile to anyone's face, and to "turn down for what" better than any 6'4" male we know, that makes Mac particularly special.

                        Allison will never forget the first full conversation she had with Madeleine. On the subway after leaving a mutual friend's curated art show on the Lower East Side, Allison was amazed to find that this effortlessly chic, demur, and incredibly intelligent New Yorker would be talking with her. That evening was the springboard for what would soon become long conversations over lunch between classes, sifting through dirt at an archaeological site in Sicily, and rooming together as they toured ancient architecture of Grecian islands. Over the years, no topic has been barred from their conversation; from politics, art, fashion, and the joys and frustrations of graduate school to the topic of dating, which before long turned to their nearly simultaneous engagements and subsequent wedding planning. Ever thoughtful, sagacious, and sage, Madeleine is an incredible fount of wisdom for us both. She grounds us and continues to remind us of what is truly most important in life.

                        Our wedding location in Charleston is made all the more special by Sarah, who first met Allison 12 years ago in that city while attending Governor's School (i.e. summer nerd camp for high schoolers). Over the years, fate repeatedly brought the two together through unplanned and unexpected reunions. It was ultimately in 2012 in Philadelphia that the two met yet again to find that their paths had aligned to the point that Sarah was now an editor in NYC overseeing publications in the very academic field Allison was working in. While they continue to bond over their shared Carolinian origins, their career pursuits in the Big Apple, and for their love of all related football topics (college and NFL a top fall priority), they've become even closer spending time with the two wonderful men who have entered their lives. Sarah and her husband, Alex, as well as their two amazing cats, Alice and Annie, are truly like family to us, and we honestly don't know what we'd do without them.

                        Regardless of blood relations, Stephanie has truly been the eldest sister of Allison, Meredith, and Jennifer... and as early as Allison can remember, she has always been the coolest person we knew. Growing up, she introduced Allison and Meredith to contraband items, such as MTV and temporary arm tattoos, she was the captain of her high school cheerleading squad, and she was the only person on either side of the Mason-Dixon Line that we knew who could consume 16 fried chickens in one sitting. Though many things have changed since their childhood, Allison still looks up to Stephanie as her coolest older sister. Steph puts her heart and soul into her job as an educator, and her resilience to adversity is unparalleled. She also refuses to acknowledge that there is an "I" in "family." Even when her sister was in the hospital and she herself was battling a severe illness, she was overjoyed when she heard of the news of our engagement and wanted to celebrate it as if it were her own.

                        Inventor, entrepreneur, engineer, sports fan, and awesome father and brother are just a few of the many important roles that Steve plays in life. He is also the most talkative of the Garber clan (indeed a truly extraordinary feat for all of you who know Joe), and will never shy from extolling the many virtues of Clemson football (an even greater feat given that he is only a recent convert as a diehard Clemson fan). Steve has always been selfless in offering his support and encouragement to both Joe and Allison over the years of their relationship, and we look up to him and his wife, Libet, as examples of the healthy partners in marriage that we seek to become. As an added bonus, we are delighted that his daughter, Maria, will join the bridal party as our flower girl!
